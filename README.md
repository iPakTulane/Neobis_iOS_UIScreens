# Neobis_iOS_UIScreens
A collection of UI screens created in code (no Storyboard)  
This project focuses on building complex, custom screens in iOS without using Storyboard. The goal is to gain proficiency in Swift programming and layout design using programmatic methods. 

## Design

## Project Overview

In this project, I was tasked with:

- Mastering the Swift programming language.
- Learning how to design and layout screens without relying on Storyboard.
- Creating five complex and custom screens with a strictly defined design.
- Ensuring that all screens are adaptive to various device sizes and orientations.

## Project Requirements

The key requirements for this project include:

- **Complex Custom Screens:** I was designing and implementing five complex screens, each with its own unique layout and functionality.

- **No Storyboard:** It's crucial to build these screens entirely without the use of Storyboard, focusing on programmatic approaches for UI design.

## Technologies and Libraries

To accomplish this project successfully, I needed to use the following technologies and libraries:

- **UITabBarController:** I utilized UITabBarController to manage the tab-based navigation of your app.

- **NSLayoutConstraint:** Auto Layout is crucial for creating adaptive and responsive interfaces.

- **View Hierarchy:** Understanding and managing the view hierarchy is essential for building complex custom screens.
