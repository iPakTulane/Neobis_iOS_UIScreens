# Neobis_iOS_UIScreens
A collection of UI screens created in code (no Storyboard). This project focuses on building complex, custom screens in iOS without using Storyboard. The goal is to gain proficiency in Swift programming and layout design using programmatic methods. 

The app contains screens of the following screens:
- Library 
- Weather
- Finance
- Travel
- Crypto

## Library
The Library screen provides users with a collection of digital content such as books, articles, or any other media. Users can navigate through their library, view details about each item, and perform actions like reading, downloading, or sharing content.

## Weather 
The Weather screen displays real-time weather information based on the user's location or a selected location. Users can check current weather conditions, forecasts, and additional details such as humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. The screen may also include interactive elements for location selection or weather map viewing.

## Finance 
The Finance screen offers users insights into their financial status. It can include features like account balances, transaction history, budget tracking, investment portfolios, and financial goal monitoring. Users can manage and analyze their financial data in an organized and user-friendly interface.

## Travel 
The Travel screen assists users in planning and organizing their travel experiences. It may include features like destination suggestions, itinerary planning, hotel reservations, flight information, and local recommendations. Users can explore travel options, create trip plans, and access essential travel information.

## Crypto 
The Crypto screen is dedicated to cryptocurrency-related information. Users can track real-time prices, view historical data, and analyze trends for various cryptocurrencies. The screen may also include features for managing cryptocurrency portfolios, setting alerts, and accessing news related to the crypto market.

## Project Overview

In this project, I was tasked with:
- Mastering the Swift programming language.
- Learning how to design and layout screens without relying on Storyboard.
- Creating five complex and custom screens with a strictly defined design.
- Ensuring that all screens are adaptive to various device sizes and orientations.

## Project Requirements

The key requirements for this project include:
- **Complex Custom Screens:** I was designing and implementing five complex screens, each with its own unique layout and functionality.
- **No Storyboard:** It's crucial to build these screens entirely without the use of Storyboard, focusing on programmatic approaches for UI design.

## Technologies and Libraries

To accomplish this project successfully, I needed to use the following technologies and libraries:
- **UITabBarController:** I utilized UITabBarController to manage the tab-based navigation of your app.
- **NSLayoutConstraint:** Auto Layout is crucial for creating adaptive and responsive interfaces.
- **View Hierarchy:** Understanding and managing the view hierarchy is essential for building complex custom screens.
